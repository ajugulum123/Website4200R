    <section>
        <p>I have been passionate about football and Barcelona for 4 years. I started watching after Leo Messi won his first international title
            which was the Copa America. I fell in love with the passion of the fans internationally, which led me to explore Club football and playing the
            sport within domestic leagues such as the English Premier League, the Italian Serie A, and the Spanish La Liga. I chose Barca since it was the club of my favorite player,
            Leo Messi. However, due to financial issues, Barca had to terminate his contract, and he departed from the club. The club had a rough year by its standards, finishing a
            distant second in La Liga behind its arch-rivals, Real Madrid. However, Xavi, a club legend, was appointed as manager. This was the first domino to fall towards the club's resurgence.
            Xavi tapped into the fountain of youth, La Masia, to develop the squad as they did not have a big enough transfer budget. Thus, with this young squad
            full of players who love the club more than anything, along with new veterans such as Robert Lewandowski and Raphinha, Xavi was able to win the La Liga title. Now, after a
            disappointing 2023/24 campaign, Xavi left the club, making way for Hansi Flick, who has rejuvenated the squad to play as one of the best in the world.
